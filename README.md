# locket_flutter

i *know* you have seen the famous locket app, where you can remind your lover everyday how much you love them. well, only if you have an iphone ig. so i decided my first venture into flutter to be with locket_flutter.

Using a ghetto-ass server in the form of a burning-hot stolen raspberry-pi, somehow learning how things work in both ios and android, setting up some sort of background services and homescreen widget, i hope i can show my gf how much i love her. also to show my future employers how much i love the hustle and how valuable of an asset i am lol.

## checklist
- create a settings page to save and manage variables such as ftp address, partnerid and regenerate your own id - *done*
- figure out how to get the camera to work
- save pics as files
- save them to the ftp server
- create widgets
- background service to take care of updating the widget
- add **_pizzaz_**
